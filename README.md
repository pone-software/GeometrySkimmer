From an input i3 file and a csv file specifying a subset of string IDs:
  Produces a reduced GCD file
  Removes I3Photons from Q frames that are on 'missing' strings
  Deletes now empty Q frames

The notebook and identical python script in the examples/ show a way to visualize the subselection and produce the input csv file
